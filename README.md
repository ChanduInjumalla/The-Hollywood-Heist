# The-Hollywood-Heist
This project is an end-to-end analysis of IMDb Top 1000 movies. I used Python (Pandas) to clean a messy CSV and stored it in an SQLite database.I then used SQL to query this clean data for insights on directors, genres, and trends.I built a professional, interactive dashboard in Power BI with KPI cards, charts, and slicers to visualize the results.
